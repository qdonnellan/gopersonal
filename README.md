# gopersonal
*An experiment in learning Go.*

This has become my personal website, which you can see live at [qdonnellan.com](http://www.qdonnellan.com). I'm hopeful that this is also a useful tool for others learning Go on Google App Engine. Feel free to clone this and use it at the basis for your own Go app. 

## How to run locally:

1. Clone this repository into a `src` folder on your GOPATH. My GOPATH is set to `$home/go`. So, this folder lives in: `$home/go/src/github/go-personal`. 
2. Make sure you've successfully installed the App Engine SDK for Go, [which can be found here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/). Actually, I recommend reading everything there before starting anything else. 
3. Navigate to the app folder in this repo, and run `goapp serve`.
